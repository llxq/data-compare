 * This method is like `clone` except that it recursively clones `value`.

 * @returns {*} Returns the deep cloned value.
 * @see clone
 * @example
 *

 *
 * const deep = cloneDeep(objects)
 * console.log(deep[0] === objects[0])
 * // => false

 * Performs a deep comparison between two values to determine if they are
 * equivalent.
 *
 * **Note:** This method supports comparing arrays, array buffers, booleans,
 * date objects, error objects, maps, numbers, `Object` objects, regexes,
 * sets, strings, symbols, and typed arrays. `Object` objects are compared
 * by their own, not inherited, enumerable properties. Functions and DOM
 * nodes are **not** supported.
 * var object = { 'a': 1 };
 * var other = { 'a': 1 };
 *
 * _.isEqual(object, other);
 * // => true
 *
 * object === other;
 * // => false
